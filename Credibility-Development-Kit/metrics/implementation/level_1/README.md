# IMPLEMENTATION - LEVEL 1

A collection of metrics that can be used for assessing the credibility of simulation model implementation, according to Credibility Level 1:

* [`check_fmu_model_description`](#check_fmu_model_description): Checks the modelDescription.xml of an FMU
* [`checkExpertCodeReview`](#checkexpertcodereview): Checks if an artifact has passed the expert review (e.g., code verification) and if the signed expert statement is valid
* [`checkSystemStructure`](#checksystemstructure): Static code check, if a system structure (including all components, connectors and connections of the system) is well-defined
* [`checkPlausibility`](#checkplausibility): Dynamic code check, if a parameter change will be resulting in the expected behaivor of the simulation 

---

## `check_fmu_model_description`

Static code check, that checks the modelDescription.xml of a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). It uses the [FMPy module](https://pypi.org/project/FMPy/), which is also used by the official FMU Validator of the [Modelica Association](https://fmi-standard.org/validation/).

The metric checks the modelDescription.xml of a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU):
- validation against the XML schema, uniqueness and validity of variable names
- completeness and integrity of the ModelStructure
- required start values
- combinations of causality and variability
- units

## `checkExpertCodeReview`

*Static code check, if any produced code to build and run simulations passes certain quality criterions (e.g., IEEE 730). This is done by an expert wo needs to give a statement about this action*.

### I. METADATA
---------------------------

Metric properties ||
------------------------|---------------
Domains                 | Domain-independent
Model types             | Model-independent
CSP phase               | Implementation

Implements              | Static Code Check
Acceptance criteria     | Expert Statement
Implementations         | Node.JS

### II. USAGE
---------------------------

This metric is to be considered as implicite metric, i.e. both the quality metric and the quality criterion is evaluated by an expert, who's giving a statement about the metric, the criterion and its results. Consider the following example:

*Preparation step 1, expert statement:*

A qualified expert makes a static code review (*metric*), as part of the Software Quality Assurance, according to best practices and the standard IEEE 730 (*criterion*).

The result of the first step is the expert statement. The content of the expert statement itself must contain the reduced result of the check (true/false) and the verbal statement, according to the following approach:

```javascript
{
    result: true,
    log: "Performed static code review, as part of the Software Quality Assurance, according to best practices and IEEE 730. As a result, the code is free of deficiencies and errors (see file unit-test-results.json)."
}
```

*Preparation step 2, sign expert statment:* 

The expert check must be wrapped into the content of the signedStatement object, as can be observed below. This object must be stringified to be used as input of `checkExpertCodeReview`. For ease of use, the structure can be generated, using the [sign function of the veri-sign util](https://github.com/virtual-vehicle/Credibility-Assessment-Framework/tree/main/Credibility-Development-Kit/util/veri-sign).

*Evaluate signed statment:*

The `checkExpertCodeReview` function takes the signed expert statement and the X509 certificate as inputs to check if the statement has been signed by the holder of the X509 certificate.

The X509 certificate to be passed must be PEM- or DER-encoded. If PEM is used, a string is expected, if DER is used, a Buffer is expected.

```javascript
signedStatement = '{"content":{"result":true,"log":"Performed static code review, as part of the Software Quality Assurance, according to best practices and IEEE 730. As a result, the code is free of deficiencies and errors (see file unit-test-results.json)."},"signature":"09f41fd02ab1a891cf92b7228d...997d93efa9b1b52712372","hash_algorithm":"SHA256","signature_encoding":"hex"}';
x509Pem = `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIENzCCAx+gAwIBAgIUIUdYlY0Da5/4K/kAvFGkcpO1j9kwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL
...
nsA7g4QT5oCHJnRtfLXMgMdW+/Q76CqJgYsT
-----END CERTIFICATE-----`;

checkExpertCodeReview(signedStatement, x509Pem);
```

The function will check...

* ...the type and schema validity of the inputs
* ...the result of the expert statment itself
* ...the validity of the X509 certificate
* ...the validity of the signature

The output will be a ResultLog, indicating the result and additional logging information, as can be observed in the example below.

```javascript
{
    result: true,
    log: "Performed static code review, as part of the Software Quality Assurance, according to best practices and IEEE 730. As a result, the code is free of deficiencies and errors (see file unit-test-results.json)."
}
```

### III. INPUTS
---------------------------

Input for the expert || 
------------------------|---------------
Entity kind             | Code to build and execute the simulation
Entity type             | Any simulation code (models, parameters, test cases, etc.)
Must contain            | Production code that is used for the planned delivered simulation

### IV. OUTPUTS
---------------------------

|| Review passed
------------------------|---------------
Event                   | Code review passed
Result                  | true
Log                     | Performed static code review of (...), as part of the Software Quality Assurance, according to (...). The code is free of deficiencies and errors

|| Review not passed
------------------------|---------------
Event                   | Code likely to throw errors
Result                  | false
Log                     | Performed static code review of (...), as part of the Software Quality Assurance, according to (...). The implementation will likely throw errors. Code needs to be improved.

### V. EXAMPLES:
---------------------------

We consider a signed expert statement and two X509 certificates.

The expert is giving a statement about code review steps:

```javascript
// expert_statement.json

{
    "content": "Performed static code review, as part of the Software Quality Assurance, according to best practices and IEEE 730. As a result, the code is free of deficiencies and errors.",
    "signature": "b624eb92338308702b...00514ff050a656",
    "hash_algorithm": "SHA256",
    "signature_encoding": "hex"
}
```
We try to verify the statement with the following certificates:

```
// x509_john_doe_2022.pem

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEDzCCAvegAwIBAgIUdBgY79Rx8iKuwNuP6KXS6/xUoJ8wDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL
...
ltREsqyrgXMibih7xDCXyZyInzl33U9pFd8hi0gi81MC7jU=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

```
// x509_john_doe_2019.pem

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEJTCCAw2gAwIBAgIUVaAGmS8al7x9alHAF/9nhEKLDP0wDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL
...
stEAxvDWkktb
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const metrics = require(".");

const expertStatement = fs.readFileSync("./examples/statements/expert_statement.json", "utf8");
const cert2019 = fs.readFileSync("./examples/certificates/x509_john_doe_2019.pem", "utf8");
const cert2022 = fs.readFileSync("./examples/certificates/x509_john_doe_2022.pem", "utf8");

const result2022 = metrics.checkExpertCodeReview(expertStatement, cert2022);
// will return 
// { result: true, log: 'The expert statement has been proven valid' }

const result2019 = metrics.checkExpertCodeReview(expertStatement, cert2019);
// will return 
// { result: false, log: 'The expert statement could not be proven valid (X509 certificate expired)' }
```

For observing some examples, see [here](./examples/examples_verify_expert_statement.js), or use

```
npm run example-expert-statement
```

from a terminal, for running the examples.

## `checkSystemStructure`

*Static code check, if a representation of a system structure (including all components, connectors and connections of the system) is well-defined. That means it verifies if all subsystems are uniquely identifiable, if all required inputs are connected unambigouosly, if the data types of the connected element's connectors are consistent and if each element a connection references to is exactly available once in a subsystem*

### I. METADATA
---------------------------

Metric properties ||
------------------------|---------------
Domains                 | Domain-independent
Model types             | Models in system simulations
CSP phase               | Implementation
CSP step                | Models
Level                   | 1
Purpose                 | Checks, if a system structure is well-defined
Implements              | Static Code Check
Acceptance criteria     | Logic check
Implementations         | Node.JS

### II. USAGE
--------------------------- 

This quality metric belongs to the category of static code checks. The input to this function represents a generic data structure, that can be translated from a System Structure Definition (SSD) file. SSD is specified as a standard within the Modelica SSP[^1]. 
The metric checks if the system representation is well-defined and can be implemented in general, which means, the quality criterion follows boolean logic (either it is well-defined or not). However, the quality criterion can be softened by defining input connectors that do not need a connection (e.g., because the input uses default values). In the following snippet the the input "supply_voltage" of the component "pressure_sensor" does not require to be connected:

```javascript
let systemStructure = "...";
let noConnectionNeeded = JSON.stringify([
    {
        "subsystem": ["seat", "surface"],
        "element": "pressure_sensor",
        "name": "supply_voltage",
        "kind": "input",
        "type": "Real"
    }
]);

let result = checkSystemStructure(systemStructure, noConnectionNeeded);
```

### III. INPUTS

systemStructure || 
------------------------|---------------
Unserialized data type  | JSON object

### V. EXAMPLES

Consider the following example of a simple system model of a DC motor:

![system model example](./docs/system_model_example.png "System Model example")

The system has been translated from the SSD standard format and results in the [following generic data structure](./examples/system_structures/dc_motor_example.json "System Structure example").

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const metrics = require(".");

const systemStructure = fs.readFileSync("./examples/system_structures/dc_motor_example.json", "utf8");

const result = metrics.checkSystemStructure(systemStructure);
// will return 
// { result: true, log: 'system structure is well-defined' }
```

If we change for instance the type of the output connector "phi" of the mechanical model to "Integer" like given in the following
```javascript
{
    "subsystem": ["dc_motor_system", "dc_motor"],
    "element": "mechanics",
    "name": "phi",
    "kind": "output",
    "type": "Integer"
}
```
the check will return a negative result, as the types of the associated connection are no longer consistent:
```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const metrics = require(".");

const systemStructure = fs.readFileSync("./examples/system_structures/dc_motor_example_type_inconsistent.json", "utf8");

const result = metrics.checkSystemStructure(systemStructure);
// will return 
// { result: false, log: 'data types for the Connectors of the following Connection are not equal: {"subsystem":["dc_motor_system","dc_motor"],"element_start":"mechanics","name_start":"phi","element_end":"electrics","name_end":"phi"}' }
```

If we skip an input connection, for example the following connection
```javascript
{
    "subsystem": ["dc_motor_system", "dc_motor"],
    "element_start": "",
    "name_start": "U_0",
    "element_end": "electrics",
    "name_end": "U_0"
}
```
the check will return a negative result, as well, unless we don't declare the destination of the connection to not require a connection:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const metrics = require(".");

const systemStructure = fs.readFileSync("./examples/system_structures/dc_motor_example_input_not_connected.json", "utf8");
const inputNotRequired = JSON.stringify([
    {
        "subsystem": ["dc_motor_system", "dc_motor"],
        "element": "electrics",
        "name": "U_0",
        "kind": "input",
        "type": "Real"
    }
]);

const result1 = metrics.checkSystemStructure(systemStructure);
// will return 
// { result: false, log: 'The following input connector is not connected: {"subsystem":["dc_motor_system","dc_motor"],"element":"electrics","name":"U_0","kind":"input","type":"Real"}' }

const result2 = metrics.checkSystemStructure(systemStructure, inputNotRequired);
// will return 
// { result: false, log: 'system structure is well-defined' }
```
